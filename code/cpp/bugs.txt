Symptom:
  my_file.cpp:5: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope

Explanation:
  the 'cout' output stream is defined in the standard namespace. If you want to use it, you have to either be "using namespace std;" or you have to explicitly specify cout with the std:: prefix, like "std::cout"

Cure(s):
  Be sure to #include<iostream> and issue the statement "using namespace std;"
