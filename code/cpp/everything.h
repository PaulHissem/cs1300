  5. Declaring and Defining functions.

  Hopefully you got here from reading through everything.cpp.

  Since this is the header file, we can't (or shouldn't) actually
  define functions here. The purpose of the header file is to
  _declare_ functions: tell the compiler what things are called, what
  they return, and what kinds of parameters they expect.

  All we're going to do here is declare a function called
  `recite_lyrics` that returns nothing and accepts nothing on input.
  Here's how we do that:
*/

void recite_lyrics();

/*
  That's all! 'void' means the function has no return value,
  'recite_lyrics' is the name of the function, the empty parentheses
  mean it takes no input parameters. We close off the statement with a
  semicolon in order to conform to C++'s syntax. Easy.

  Now go back to everything.cpp and continue where you left off.
